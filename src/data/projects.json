    "summary": "Architecting the application layer and CI/CD workflows for a regulatory system collecting customer data to meet EU GDPR requirements.",
    "problem": [
      "The bank required a centralized system to collect customer data from various systems to fulfill EU GDPR requirements (Right of Access).",
      "The challenge involved integrating disparate banking systems, ensuring high observability, and enabling a team of developers new to the Java/Spring ecosystem to deliver production-ready code."

    "solution": [
      "Configured OpenShift namespaces and resource quotas for the project.",
      "Designed and implemented robust CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps for automated delivery.",
      "Developed a comprehensive Java/Spring Boot application skeleton that served as a standardized blueprint for the team.",
      "Configured full observability (monitoring, logging, alerting) using Prometheus and Grafana.",
      "Onboarded and mentored 3 developers, guiding them from zero to proficiency in Spring Boot."

    "architecture": [
      "The system functioned as an event-driven consumer listening to Kafka topics.",
      "Upon receiving a trigger, it orchestrated data retrieval from multiple banking systems, generated a comprehensive PDF report, and securely uploaded it to a file repository accessible via mobile and web channels for the end customer."
    ],
    "result": [
      "Successfully met strict regulatory deadlines.",
      "The mentored team delivered a stable, high-quality application independently.",
      "The automated pipeline and observability setup reduced operational overhead to a minimum."

    "summary": "High-performance middleware connecting internal service discovery with an on-premise 3rd party translation engine for a multi-country contact center.",
    "problem": [
      "The Contact Center required real-time translation support for chatbots and agents across multiple countries.",
      "The core challenge was integrating a 'black-box' on-premise vendor application. It lacked native observability, making it difficult to guarantee SLAs, debug errors, or analyze translation quality during traffic peaks."
    ],
    "solution": [
      "Developed a robust Gateway application using Java and Spring Boot, deployed on OpenShift with zero-downtime deployment strategies.",
      "Engineered the entire infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines from scratch to ensure seamless updates without service interruption.",
      "Implemented a 'Deep Observability' layer: created custom metrics and logging wrappers to illuminate the 'black box' behavior, tracking request payloads, latency, and error rates.",
      "Designed the architecture for high availability (HA) and horizontal scalability to withstand massive traffic spikes."

    "architecture": [
      "The Gateway acts as a smart proxy / adapter layer.",
      "It intercepts requests from the Banking Ecosystem (Service Discovery), enriches them with required metadata, and routes them to the on-premise vendor engine.",
      "All traffic is asynchronously monitored via Micrometer/Prometheus to ensure zero impact on latency."
    ],
    "result": [
      "Achieved a perfect 100% availability record over two years.",
      "Successfully performed seamless deployments with zero downtime, maintaining continuous service even during updates.",
      "Transformed a 'black box' system into a transparent service, providing critical metrics that allowed business teams to improve translation quality."
